JavaScript is a famous scripting language used to create magic on sites to make the site interactive for the user. there are no. of frameworks and libraries are: AngularJs, React.js,JQuery,Flutter . second is backened developemnt:It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side of the website works fine. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application. backened languages are c++,java,php,python node.js. c++ ,python, java: It is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used nowadays for competitive programming.It is also used as a backend language. Backened frameworks are express,django,ruby etc.

Que 3.Explain the working procedure of virtual DOM?
The DOM which can be thought of as the blueprint of a website gets updated with every change that is made to a page. If an image is removed from a gallery the whole gallery is re-rendered.
the Virtual DOM is a lightweight layer that receives any changes made to the webpage before the DOM sees and makes updates. Taking the form of a JavaScript object the Virtual DOM receives the change and creates a new version of itself but does not update anything on the physical page, meaning less processing power is required.
The process takes the following steps: 1.A change is made to the site
2.The entire virtual DOM gets updated (no changes are made to the webpage at this stage)
3.The updated virtual DOM gets compared to its previous state. React then figures out which objects have changed.
4.The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
5.Changes in the real DOM cause the screen to change and update to the new state
  
Que4.Mention some difference between MYSQL and No SQL?
Ans4.MySQL is a relational database. It’s because the data in MySQL is saved in different tables, and relationships are made using primary keys or foreign keys.
Both small and large businesses can profit from MySQL. Because of its speed and it is easy to use. It is a very powerful application in and of itself, handling a significant percentage of the functionality of the most costly and complex database products.
A NoSQL is a database that provides a system to store and retrieve data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
The key drivers for this particular data structure can be because of its ease of horizontal scaling to machine clusters, better availability control, and simple design.
The main applications for NoSQL databases are real-time web applications and big data. These kinds of databases have become more and more common in the early twenty-first century.
MySQL is a relational database with a tabular design. NoSQL, on the other, has a document-based design and is not relational in nature.
MySQL has stockpiled a database that covers a major section of the IT market, whereas NoSQL databases are relatively new and are still growing in popularity among big IT firms.
The NoSQL database has arrived recently and has a relatively small community in comparison to the MySQL database, which has a significantly large community and a stable business.
  
Que5. Explain any one DBMS technology in your own words?
A database management system (DBMS) is a computer program designed to manage a large amount of structured data, and run operations on the desired data requested by the users. the best example of DBMS is Banking. All the transactions that take place are based on a defined software program which keeps track of all the data.A collection of information which is managed such that it can be updated and easily accessed is called a database. A software package which can be used to manipulate, validate and retrieve this database is called a Database Management System.
Data Manipulation Languages (DML) – This is a programming language used to insert or modify the data present in a database  These are of two types: SQL and DDL.
Structured Query Language (SQL) – A programming language generally used for the relational database management system, which comprises tables.
Data Definition Language (DDL) – It is a syntax which helps in modifying data present in the form of tables or indexes
Primary Key – Each file has a unique key. Using the Primary Key, a specific file can be identified
Foreign Key – The relation between a field in one table and component identified by a primary key can be detected using a Foreign Key.
